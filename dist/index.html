       <p>Swing dance is a group of dances that developed with the swing style of jazz music in the 1920sâ€“1940s, with the origins of each dance predating the popular <strong>"swing era"</strong>. Hundreds of styles of swing dancing were developed; those that have survived beyond that era include <strong>Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag,</strong> and <strong>Charleston</strong>.<br>
<br>Today, the best-known of these dances is the Lindy Hop, which originated in Harlem in the early 1930s. While the majority of swing dances began in African American communities as vernacular African American dances, some influenced swing-era dances, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities.
